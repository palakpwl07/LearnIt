In the modern world, continuous learning is not just an advantage—it's a necessity. LearnIt empowers you to make informed decisions about your education, ensuring that you invest in certifications that will keep you relevant and competitive in your field.

## My Journey

As a dedicated and continuous learner, I faced the problem of confusion myself. Forums like Reddit are flooded with opinions about which certifications are better, and it can be overwhelming to decide where to invest your time and money. Therefore, I decided to address this problem  and developed this concept was developed as part of **MA5005 (Startup: From Zero to Million)** at Nanyang Technological University. Through this project, I delved into the intricacies of startup development, leveraging my engineering background to create solutions for widespread issues. This experience honed my pitching skills, fostered creativity, and culminated in an A+ grade for the course.

## Business Model and Vision

My primary revenue streams include affiliate marketing and Google AdSense. As I scale and attract more users, I aim to merge with and collaborate with platforms like LinkedIn to make learning even more accessible. My vision is to build a community where learning is not just a task but a fostered, enjoyable experience.
